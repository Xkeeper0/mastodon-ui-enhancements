/*
	this is some user css you can add to stylebot or whatever your user-css-allowing extension is,
	or your mastodon instance itself if you want

	sample image of most changes:
	general ui:      https://icosahedron.website/@Xkeeper/100765176052010274
	media uploader:  https://icosahedron.website/@Xkeeper/100765236260841467
	pinned posts:    https://icosahedron.website/@Xkeeper/100787770095983939

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	features:

	- attempts to disable most animations, well beyond the ui's "less animations" setting
		- MAY cause issues, as some parts of the ui require this to work (/why/)

	- turns tombstones into a tired and ancient meme
		- tombstones are the "Filtered" boxes where filtered posts go
		- uncomment the part that says "display: none" to just hide them instead
		- (may also make them a little smaller; UI will act weird if a timeline is mostly filtered)

	- removes forced-capitalization everywhere
		- "TOOT" now "Toot", "SHOW MORE/HIDE MORE" just "Show more/Hide more"
		- Please get off the internet, grandpa

	- makes the cw input box always visible, adds heading saying "subject / content warning"
		- removes placeholder text (can't change it via css, rip)
		- functionality works even without the button; adding text = cw enabled, leaving blank = off

	- makes the under-composer buttons better
		- "single icon, flat" -> "button-like, full width, has text explaining it"
		- distinctive visual effects for hovering, focusing, and toggling them
		- removed "cw" button since no longer useful (see first change)
		- "direct message" privacy mode has blue text to indicate it is fundamentally different
		- default privacy level has slightly gray text to indicate it's the default
			- makes changes in privacy level a bit more obvious
			- this part *requires* you to change the css below to whatever you use as the default
			- the font for the button is hardcoded, because :gargron: made that button work different
			- worst and clunkiest part of this entire ui i s2g

	- makes the media uploader interface better
		- controls always visible
		- controls now turn white when active/focused so you can see where your cursor is
		- image desc. field always visible, has padding / border to be very obvious
		- image desc. field has red placeholder if the description is left blank

	- avatars in timelines now have a dark background
		- makes it a little more obvious if someone's using a fully transparent png or whatever

	- pinned posts/toots in user profiles in the ui are more distinctive
		- pinned posts have darker background
		- pinned posts have a border on the bottom and top
		- "Pinned Toot" header stands out visually, has bold text

	- collapses favorite/boost notifications in the notification column for easier viewing
		- great if you get a lot, and want to focus on replies w/o turning them off totally
		- may be annoying
